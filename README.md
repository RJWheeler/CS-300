# CS-300

Portfolio Submission – ABCU Advising Assistance Program
Overview

This portfolio submission includes selected components from Projects One and Two completed for CS 300. The purpose of these projects was to design, analyze, and implement data structures to manage and organize course information for the ABC University (ABCU) Computer Science department.

Project One Artifact: Analysis of run-time and memory performance for various data structures used to store course information.

Project Two Artifact: Fully functional C++ program that loads course data from a CSV file, organizes it in a binary search tree, and prints an alphanumeric list of courses.

These artifacts demonstrate proficiency in designing and implementing algorithms and data structures to solve real-world programming problems efficiently.

Reflection

In the projects for this course, the main problem I was solving involved designing efficient data structures to store, manage, and retrieve course information for a university advising program. The goal was to build a program capable of reading data from a file, organizing it in a structured format, and printing course information in alphanumeric order. Another key objective was to analyze the run-time and memory performance of different data structures to determine which would be most effective for the task.

My approach to solving these problems focused on selecting and implementing appropriate data structures, such as binary search trees, to store and retrieve course information efficiently. Understanding data structures is critical because they directly impact how fast and memory-efficient a program can be. By comparing structures like vectors, hash tables, and trees, I learned how their organization and access patterns influence algorithm performance. Using a binary search tree, for example, allowed me to maintain sorted order while keeping lookup times efficient.

Throughout the projects, I encountered several roadblocks, such as properly parsing CSV files, handling user input errors, and ensuring that the search feature worked regardless of capitalization. I overcame these issues by testing the program iteratively, researching C++ string and file-handling functions, and debugging logic errors step by step. This process taught me how to think critically about both the structure and the flow of data through a program.

Working on these projects expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing planning and modularity. I learned the importance of organizing code into classes and functions that each serve a clear purpose. It also changed the way I think about writing programs—focusing on readability, maintainability, and adaptability. Clear code organization, meaningful variable names, and consistent commenting have become part of my normal development process, ensuring that my code is easier to modify and understand in the future.
